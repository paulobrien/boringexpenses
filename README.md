# Boring Expenses

A React TypeScript expense management application with both web and native mobile support using Expo.

## Features

- **Web Application**: Built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS
- **Native Mobile App**: Built with React Native and Expo
- **Shared Codebase**: Common business logic and components between platforms
- **Supabase Backend**: Authentication, database, and file storage
- **AI-Powered**: OCR receipt processing and smart categorization

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v20.19.4 or later
- npm 10.8.2 or later
- Expo CLI (installed automatically with dependencies)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Copy environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Configure your Supabase credentials in `.env`:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

### Running the Applications

#### Web Development
```bash
npm run dev          # Start web development server (Vite)
npm run build        # Build web application
npm run preview      # Preview built web application
```

#### Mobile Development
```bash
npm run mobile       # Start Expo development server
npm run start        # Alias for mobile development
npm run android      # Start for Android device/emulator
npm run ios          # Start for iOS device/simulator (macOS only)
```

#### Additional Commands
```bash
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
```

### Platform-Specific Files

- **Web**: Uses standard React components in `src/components/`
- **Mobile**: Uses React Native components in `src/components/mobile/`
- **Shared**: Authentication (`src/hooks/useAuth.ts`) and Supabase client (`src/lib/supabase.ts`)

### Project Structure

â””â”€â”€ ...
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Web Development**: Use `npm run dev` for fast development with Vite
2. **Mobile Development**: Use `npm run mobile` to start Expo dev server
3. **Testing**: Use Expo Go app on your phone or simulators for mobile testing
4. **Building**: Web builds with `npm run build`, mobile builds through Expo Build Service
