# User Roles Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of user roles for company administrators in the Boring Expenses application.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- Added `user_role` enum type with values: 'employee', 'manager', 'admin'
- Added `role` column to `profiles` table with default value 'employee'
- First user of each company is automatically assigned 'admin' role
- Updated RLS policies to allow admins to manage other users in their company

### 2. TypeScript Types
- Updated `Database` type in `supabase.ts` to include role field
- Enhanced `UserProfile` interface to include role
- Added proper type safety for role operations

### 3. Authentication & Authorization
- Enhanced `useAuth` hook with role-based helper functions:
  - `isAdmin()` - Check if user is admin
  - `isManager()` - Check if user is manager or admin
  - `canManageUsers()` - Check if user can manage other users
  - `canApproveExpenses()` - Check if user can approve expenses

### 4. User Interface Components

#### UserManagement Component
- Complete user management interface for company administrators
- View all company users with their roles and join dates
- Edit user roles (admin, manager, employee)
- Invite new users functionality (placeholder)
- Proper access control - only admins can access

#### Settings Component Updates
- Display current user's role with colored badge
- Conditionally show UserManagement section for admins
- Enhanced company information section

#### AppLayout Component Updates
- Display user role badge in sidebar
- Visual role indicators with appropriate colors

## Role Permissions

### Employee (Default)
- Submit and manage their own expenses
- View their own expense history
- Update their profile settings

### Manager
- All employee permissions
- Approve/reject expenses (to be implemented in future iterations)
- View team expenses (to be implemented in future iterations)

### Admin
- All manager permissions
- Manage company users and their roles
- View all company expenses
- Export company data
- Cannot modify other admin roles (safety feature)

## Database Migration

File: `supabase/migrations/20250818183000_add_user_roles.sql`

Key changes:
- Creates `user_role` enum type
- Adds role column to profiles table
- Sets first user of each company as admin
- Updates RLS policies for role-based access
- Modifies user creation function to assign admin role to first user

## Security Considerations

1. **Role-Based Access Control**: Implemented at database level with RLS policies
2. **Admin Protection**: Admins cannot modify other admin roles
3. **Company Isolation**: Users can only manage users within their own company
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage for role operations

## Usage Examples

```typescript
// Check user permissions
const { isAdmin, canManageUsers } = useAuth();

if (canManageUsers()) {
  // Show user management interface
}

if (isAdmin()) {
  // Show admin-only features
}

// Update user role (admin only)
await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .update({ role: 'manager' })
  .eq('id', userId);
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Expense Approval Workflow**: Implement manager approval for expenses
2. **Team Management**: Allow managers to view their team's expenses  
3. **Role-Based Reports**: Different reporting capabilities per role
4. **Audit Logging**: Track role changes and administrative actions
5. **Email Invitations**: Complete user invitation flow with email notifications

## Testing

The implementation has been tested for:
- TypeScript compilation
- Build process
- Component rendering (with mock data)
- Database migration structure

Full end-to-end testing requires valid Supabase credentials and database setup.
