## Narrative

Maria, a sales representative, spends much of her week traveling to meet clients. She often finds herself juggling paper receipts, trying to remember which expenses she’s already submitted, and waiting weeks for reimbursement. Her manager, Alex, is equally frustrated—he receives stacks of paper reports, struggles to verify receipts, and spends hours approving expenses.

With the Smart Expenses App, Maria’s routine changes overnight. After a client lunch, she snaps a photo of her receipt, categorizes the expense, and submits it—all from her phone in under two minutes. The app confirms her submission and shows her the status in real time. Alex receives a notification, reviews the digital receipt, and approves the expense with a single tap. The finance team, in turn, accesses all approved expenses in one place and exports them for reimbursement processing.

The result? Maria gets reimbursed faster, Alex spends less time on approvals, and the finance team eliminates manual data entry. The company saves money, employees are happier, and everyone has more time to focus on what matters most.
