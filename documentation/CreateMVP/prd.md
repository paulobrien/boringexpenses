    *   Manager attempts to approve/reject an already processed report.
    *   System encounters an error during status update or notification sending.

### 5.5. Smart Receipt Processing (OCR + AI Post-processing)
**Description:** Allows users to capture a receipt via camera, and the app automatically extracts key data fields using OCR and AI for pre-population.

*   **User Stories:**
    *   As an employee, I want to take a photo of my physical receipt and have the app automatically fill in the expense details (date, vendor, amount, category), minimizing manual entry.
    *   As an employee, I want to be able to correct any details that the OCR/AI might have misinterpreted, ensuring accuracy.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Users can access their device camera or gallery to select a receipt image.
    *   The selected image is sent to an OCR service for text extraction.
    *   AI post-processing analyzes the extracted text to identify and parse:
        *   **Date:** (e.g., "2025-08-07")
        *   **Vendor Name:** (e.g., "Starbucks," "Amazon")
        *   **Total Amount:** (e.g., "15.75")
        *   **Currency:** (e.g., "USD," "GBP" - detection only, no conversion in MVP).
    *   AI suggests a **Category** based on vendor and extracted items (basic matching to predefined list).
    *   The extracted/suggested data pre-populates the expense entry form fields.
    *   Users can review and edit all pre-populated fields before saving/submitting.
    *   The original receipt image is saved and linked to the expense.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Poor image quality (blurry, dark, crumpled receipt).
    *   Receipts in a language not supported by the OCR service.
    *   Non-standard receipt formats or handwritten receipts (OCR failure, requiring manual entry).
    *   OCR misidentifies fields (e.g., confusing date with amount, or tip with total).
    *   AI incorrectly categorizes an expense (user must be able to override).
    *   Multiple purchases on one receipt (system focuses on total amount, user can add description).

### 5.6. Autofill & Predictive Entry
**Description:** The system learns from user's past entries to suggest vendor names and associated categories/amounts, speeding up manual entry.

*   **User Stories:**
    *   As an employee, when I start typing a vendor name, I want the app to suggest previous vendors I've used, so I don't have to type it fully.
    *   As an employee, once I select a vendor, I want the app to suggest the most common category and average amount I previously used for that vendor, to further speed up entry.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   As user types in the "Vendor" field, a dropdown displays previously entered vendors that match the input.
    *   When a user selects a vendor from the suggestions, the "Category" field is automatically populated with the most frequently used category for that vendor from the user's history.
    *   Optionally, the "Amount" field can be pre-filled with the average amount for that vendor from the user's history (user can override).
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   No historical data for the user or specific vendor.
    *   Multiple similar vendor names confusing the suggestions.
    *   Suggested category/amount is incorrect or irrelevant (user must override).

### 5.7. Basic Corporate Card Reconciliation
**Description:** Displays corporate card transactions within the app, allowing users to easily match them to submitted expenses.

*   **User Stories:**
    *   As an employee, I want to see my corporate card transactions listed in the app, so I know which expenses still need to be submitted.
    *   As an employee, I want to easily attach a receipt or an existing expense to a corporate card transaction.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   A dedicated section (e.g., "Card Transactions") displays a list of corporate card transactions for the authenticated user.
    *   Each transaction shows: Date, Merchant Name, Amount, Currency.
    *   Transactions are marked as "Unmatched" by default.
    *   Users can select an "Unmatched" transaction and either:
        *   Create a new expense, which is then automatically linked to the transaction.
        *   Link an existing "Draft" or "Submitted" expense to the transaction.
    *   Once matched, the transaction status changes to "Matched," and the linked expense ID is displayed.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   No corporate card transactions available for the user.
    *   Duplicate transactions from the card provider.
    *   Mismatch between transaction amount/date and expense amount/date (requires manual linking).
    *   User attempts to link an expense that's already linked to another transaction.
    *   Transaction data not immediately updated from the card provider API.
