# Expense App Project Status

## 1. Document Header

*   **Project Name:** Expenses App MVP
*   **Version:** 1.0
*   **Date:** August 7, 2025

## 2. Project Summary

*   **Project Goal:** To develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for an internal expenses management application. The MVP will enable users to efficiently submit, track, and manage their business expenses, focusing on core submission and a basic approval workflow. This initial phase aims to establish a robust foundation for future iterations incorporating advanced AI and automation features.
*   **MVP Scope:** The core focus of this MVP is on manual expense entry, receipt attachment, basic categorization, and a fundamental approval mechanism. Features such as advanced OCR with AI post-processing, predictive entry, real-time policy enforcement, AI-driven fraud detection, sophisticated analytics, and external integrations (e.g., travel, corporate cards) are explicitly out of scope for the MVP and are planned for subsequent phases.
*   **Target Timeline:** Initial target for MVP release: TBD (e.g., "End of Q4 2025").

## 3. Implementation Progress

*This section tracks the current status of key MVP features.*

**A. Core Expense Submission & Management**

*   **Feature: User Authentication & Profile Management**
    *   **Status:** [Not Started / In Progress / Completed]
    *   **Notes:** (e.g., "Basic user signup/login implemented. User profile editing pending.")
*   **Feature: Manual Expense Entry Form** (Amount, Date, Vendor, Category, Description)
    *   **Status:** [Not Started / In Progress / Completed]
    *   **Notes:** (e.g., "Front-end form design complete. Backend API integration for submission 70% complete.")
*   **Feature: Receipt Attachment** (Photo upload for manual linking to expense)
    *   **Status:** [Not Started / In Progress / Completed]
    *   **Notes:** (e.g., "File upload component integrated. Cloud storage setup finalized.")
*   **Feature: Basic Expense Categorization** (Pre-defined list of categories)
    *   **Status:** [Not Started / In Progress / Completed]
    *   **Notes:** (e.g., "Standard categories (e.g., Travel, Meals, Office Supplies) defined and available in dropdown.")
*   **Feature: Basic Currency Selection**
    *   **Status:** [Not Started / In Progress / Completed]
    *   **Notes:** (e.g., "Users can manually select from a list of common currencies for expense entry.")

**B. Expense Tracking & Approval Workflow**

*   **Feature: User Expense List View** (Dashboard showing submitted expenses and their status)
    *   **Status:** [Not Started / In Progress / Completed]
    *   **Notes:** (e.g., "Display of user's submitted expenses with basic status filters (Pending, Approved, Rejected) implemented.")
*   **Feature: Basic Manager/Admin Approval Workflow**
    *   **Status:** [Not Started / In Progress / Completed]
    *   **Notes:** (e.g., "Admin dashboard for viewing and changing expense status (Approve/Reject) in development.")

**C. Foundational Infrastructure**

*   **Feature: Database Schema & Core APIs**
    *   **Status:** [Not Started / In Progress / Completed]
    *   **Notes:** (e.g., "Initial database models for Users and Expenses complete. CRUD APIs for expenses in progress.")

## 4. Testing Status

*   **Unit Tests:**
    *   **Status:** [Not Started / In Progress / Completed]
    *   **Coverage:** (e.g., "Backend service unit test coverage: 40%")
*   **Integration Tests:**
    *   **Status:** [Not Started / In Progress / Completed]
    *   **Coverage:** (e.g., "User authentication and expense submission flow tested end-to-end.")
*   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
    *   **Status:** [Not Started / Planning]
    *   **Notes:** (e.g., "Internal UAT plan being drafted; target start date: [Date].")
*   **Bugs Identified / Resolved:** (e.g., "12 bugs identified, 8 resolved. 4 open bugs (2 Critical, 2 Medium).")

## 5. Risks and Issues

*   **Risk/Issue:** **Scope Creep** (Requests for advanced features before MVP completion)
    *   **Impact:** Diverts resources, delays core MVP delivery.
    *   **Mitigation/Resolution:** Maintain strict adherence to MVP definition. All new feature ideas are logged in a separate backlog for future consideration. Regular communication with stakeholders about MVP boundaries.
*   **Risk/Issue:** **Integration Challenges** (e.g., with chosen cloud storage provider for receipts)
    *   **Impact:** Potential delays in receipt attachment functionality.
    *   **Mitigation/Resolution:** Ongoing communication with vendor support. Exploring alternative, simpler local storage options as a fallback for MVP.
*   **Risk/Issue:** **Resource Availability** (e.g., UI/UX designer limited availability)
    *   **Impact:** Could slow down front-end development and refinement.
    *   **Mitigation/Resolution:** Prioritize critical UI/UX for MVP; allocate overflow tasks to full-stack developers; explore temporary contractor if severe.

## 6. Next Steps

*   **Priority 1:** Complete backend API endpoints for expense submission and retrieval.
    *   **Owner:** [Assigned Team/Individual]
    *   **Due Date:** [Date]
*   **Priority 2:** Finalize front-end UI/UX for the expense creation and list view.
    *   **Owner:** [Assigned Team/Individual]
    *   **Due Date:** [Date]

    *   **Owner:** [Assigned Team/Individual]
    *   **Due Date:** [Date]
*   **Priority 4:** Prepare and initiate internal User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with a small group of users.
    *   **Owner:** [Assigned Team/Individual]
    *   **Due Date:** [Date]
*   **Priority 5:** Conduct a review meeting of the MVP scope for Phase 2 planning.
