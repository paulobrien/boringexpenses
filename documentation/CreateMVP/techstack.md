As a Software Architect, I've reviewed your ambitious and forward-thinking ideas for an expenses app. Your vision heavily leverages AI and automation to transform the traditional expense management process. To turn this vision into reality, a phased approach starting with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is crucial.

### MVP Plan: Automating Expense Submission and Basic Approval

The core of your vision revolves around making expense submission effortless and smart. For the MVP, we will focus on delivering this core value proposition, specifically leveraging smart receipt processing.

**MVP Goal:** Enable users to quickly submit expenses, primarily via a mobile receipt photo, and allow designated managers to approve them.

**Key Elements of the MVP:**

1.  **User Authentication & Authorization:**
    *   Secure user registration and login (e.g., email/password, social login).
    *   Basic role-based access control (e.g., Employee, Manager, Administrator).

2.  **Expense Submission (The Core Innovation):**
    *   **Mobile Photo to Claim:** Users can take a photo of a physical receipt or upload a digital one.
    *   **Smart Receipt Processing (OCR with AI Post-Processing):**
        *   The system will use OCR to extract key data from the receipt image: **Amount, Date, Vendor, and Currency.**
        *   This extracted data will then pre-fill the expense submission form.
    *   **Manual Entry & Editing:** Users can manually input or correct expense details (Amount, Date, Vendor, Category, Currency, Description).
    *   **Receipt Attachment:** The original receipt image/file will be attached to the expense record.
    *   **Basic Expense Categories:** A pre-defined, fixed set of expense categories for selection (e.g., Travel, Meals, Office Supplies).
    *   **Basic Currency Handling:** Allow users to select the expense currency, and display it alongside a company base currency (manual conversion for now).

3.  **User Expense Management:**
    *   **Personal Dashboard:** Users can view a list of their submitted expenses with their current status (e.g., Pending, Approved, Rejected).
    *   **Expense Details:** Ability to view the full details of any submitted expense, including the attached receipt.
    *   **Edit/Delete Pending:** Users can edit or delete expenses that are still in a 'Pending' status.

4.  **Manager Approval Workflow:**
    *   **Manager Dashboard:** Managers can see a list of expenses awaiting their approval from their team.
    *   **Approve/Reject:** Ability to review expense details and the attached receipt, then approve or reject an expense with an optional comment.
    *   **Basic Notifications:** Email notifications to users upon approval or rejection of their expenses.

5.  **Basic Administration & Reporting:**
    *   **Admin View:** Administrators (e.g., Finance) can view all company expenses, filterable by user, status, date range.
    *   Export a simple list of expenses (e.g., CSV).

**What's Excluded from MVP (for future iterations):**

*   **Advanced AI:** Auto-categorization (beyond OCR extraction), smart policy enforcement, anomaly detection, AI audit assistant, AI chatbot, voice input, predictive budgeting.
*   **Workflow Automation:** Autofill/predictive entry, recurring expense detection, AI agent-based workflows.
*   **Deep Integrations:** Travel booking integration, corporate card reconciliation, calendar-contextual suggestions.
*   **Advanced Features:** Multi-language auto-detection, geolocation matching, advanced insights/analytics, personalization beyond basic user profiles.

This MVP provides immediate value by significantly reducing the manual effort in expense submission, which is a common pain point, while laying the technical foundation for future AI and automation capabilities.
